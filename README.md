## How to Use
To run this script, you need python 3 and chromedriver, you can google it yourself on how to install that. After that, you need to install required packages.

Type these command into `cmd` or `terminal` while you're on the project directory

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the script

`python3 main.py <the number of race> g?`

`g` is optional and used if you don't have typeracer account and just want to test :)

if you want to use or login to your typeracer account, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your account credential there

example:
`python3 main.py 5`
